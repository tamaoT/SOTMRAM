# SOTMRAM
Analysis using the data from SOTMRAM device

# RH
This script processes R-H loop data (resistance vs magnetic field) to extract magnetic and transport properties such as parallel/antiparallel resistance, TMR ratio, coercive field, and offset field. Useful for SOT-MRAM device analysis.

# Rsot vs Isot
Tools for analyzing Rsot vs temperature in SOT-MRAM devices to estimate internal heating (Î”T) from data(Rsot vs Isot). Includes fitting, visualization, and bias condition analysis.

# Rmtj vs Isot
This repository contains Python code for analyzing the switching behavior of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) under Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) current injection. The MTJ layer is where actual switching occurs, and this tool allows users to visualize and quantify switching events by observing changes in resistance (Rmtj).
